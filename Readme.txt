Hi!

Thanks for downloading my app and help me out to distribute it all over the NET.
Now on I will explain how it works:

*********************************************************************************

- What you may do is basically open a .ZIP file (that's how KUKA robots backup its programs) 
  and make a search throught the file system.

- It's recommendable to save any runnable JAR into a folder because my searcher makes three directories to work with.
  - decomp: here'll be any unzipped program
  - dirtree: here'll be a file with the directory tree of any unzipped program
  - history: here you will find any search you made (designed to satisfy copy&paste purposes)
